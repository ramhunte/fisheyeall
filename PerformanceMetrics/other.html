    <h1>Other Metrics</h1>

    <a href = "#otherdays"></a>
    <div id = "otherdays">
        <h2>Days at sea</h2>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Days at sea, Days fishing, processing, and steaming in AK, Days fishing, processing, and steaming on the WC, Days offloading on the WC, Days steaming between the WC and AK
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Days at sea is a measure of fishing effort and fishery participation. The catch share program in the U.S. West Coast groundfish trawl fishery was expected to result in greater specialization related to the costs of switching between other fisheries, while there were year-round fishing opportunities in the groundfish fishery (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.1.2(d)(1)). The number of days spent operating in the U.S. West Coast groundfish trawl fishery is driven by a vessel’s ability to obtain quota, fishery-specific costs, and opportunities in other fisheries relative to the groundfish fishery.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            For all U.S. West Coast fisheries and Alaskan fisheries, EDC forms for catcher vessels request information on the number of days at sea the vessel spent fishing. For catcher–processors and motherships, the forms request the number of days spent fishing and processing, steaming, and offloading in the U.S. West Coast Pacific whiting fishery, as well as the days spent steaming between the U.S. West Coast and Alaska, and fishing in Alaska. Partial days are rounded up to full days.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The following metrics are summarized as vessel averages (mean and median) and fleetwide totals:
            <li>Catcher vessels: Days at sea by fishery</li>
            <li>Catcher-processors and motherships: Days fishing, processing, and steaming in AK, Days fishing, processing, and steaming on the WC, Days offloading on the WC, Days steaming between the WC and AK </li>
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            For use in rate calculations, we use U.S. West Coast fishing days for catcher–processors and motherships, as this is most representative of fishing effort.
        </p>
    </div>

    <a href = "#otherfuel"></a>
    <div id = "otherfuel">
        <h2>Fuel use</h2>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Fuel use per day, Annual fuel use
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Fuel use per day (by fishery) provides information about the relative fuel costs across activities as well as across different vessels. This information is also used in combination with days at sea to allocate fuel costs to each fishery. Annual fuel use is also reported.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The current EDC catcher vessel form requests average fuel use per day for 11 separate fisheries. The EDC forms request fuel use per day for each fishery the vessel participates in. Catcher–processors report average fuel use for all U.S. West Coast activities combined, including fishing, processing, and steaming. Similarly, motherships report average fuel use, but only for processing and steaming, since fishing is performed by catcher vessels. Catcher–processors and motherships also report the amount of fuel used annually.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            For fuel use per day, data are summarized as reported on EDC forms, and reported as vessel averages (mean and median). Total fuel use per day is not reported. For catcher–processors and motherships, annual fuel use is also summarized as reported on EDC forms. Annual fuel use by fishery for catcher vessels is calculated by multiplying fuel use per day and days at sea by fishery. Annual fuel use is reported as vessel averages (mean and median), and fleetwide totals.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            For catcher vessels, the fisheries requested on the EDC form have changed slightly over time.

    <a href = "#othercoverage"></a>
    <div id = "othercoverage">
        <h2>Coverage of U.S. West Coast groundfish landings</h2>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Percentage of West Coast groundfish landed weight purchased, Percentage of West Coast groundfish landed value purchased.
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            These metrics summarize the percentage of total weight and value of all U.S. West Coast groundfish landed in each calendar year that are purchased by the processors in the Fisheye population. This provides an indication of Fisheye’s coverage of all U.S. West Coast groundfish landings.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Landed weight and value are obtained from state fish tickets. All groundfish landed are included, even on trips where groundfish species were not targeted. For participants that enter or exit the Fisheye population or for participants that have a fiscal year that does not align with the calendar year, the numerator includes landed weight and value purchased on dates when the participant was active in the Fisheye population.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Landed weight (or value) of groundfish species purchased by Fisheye processors in a given calendar year is divided by the total landed weight (value) of groundfish species landed on the U.S. West Coast in that calendar year, multiplied by 100. This metric is reported for the sector as a whole (total).
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Unlike other processor metrics, these metrics are reported by calendar year rather than survey year (fiscal year), as fiscal years are not known for buyers who do not submit an EDC form. These metrics do not include groundfish purchases from non-vessel sources reported on EDC forms, to avoid double-counting fish transferred between Fisheye processors.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <a href = "#otherweight"></a>
    <div id = "otherweight">
        <h2>Weight of landings/purchases</h2>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Landed weight, Purchase weight (AK), Purchase weight (WC), Catch weight (AK), Catch weight (WC).
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Fish weight landed or caught is often reported alongside ex-vessel revenue, to provide context to changes in ex-vessel revenue.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Landed weight for catcher vessels is obtained from PacFIN; and catch or purchase weight for motherships and catcher–processors is reported on the EDC forms.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Landed weight is reported by fishery for catcher vessels. Purchase weight on the U.S. West Coast and Alaska is reported separately for motherships. Catch weight on the U.S. West Coast and Alaska is reported separately for catcher–processors. Weight metrics are reported as vessel averages (mean and median) and as fleetwide totals.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            The landed weight reported for catcher vessels does not include at-sea discards.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Other metrics</h2>

    <a href = "#otherspeed"></a>
    <div id = "otherspeed">
        <h3>Speed while fishing</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Speed is collected as a vessel–fishery characteristic. This information is most useful for the development of economic models.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Similar to fuel use per day and number of crew, the EDC forms request speed while fishing (in knots) for each fishery on the U.S. West Coast that the vessel fishes in. This information is only collected for catcher vessels.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            This metric is summarized as reported as a vessel average (mean and median); it is not summarized as a fleetwide total as it would not make sense to sum all values together.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            These values are estimates and represent a vessel’s average speed while fishing in a particular fishery.
        </p>
    </div>

    <a href = "#othersharelandings"></a>
    <div id = "othersharelandings">
        <h3>Share of landings by state</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            The U.S. West Coast groundfish trawl fishery spans three states—California, Oregon, and Washington—which necessitates regional comparisons (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.1.2(d)(3)(A)). Share of landings by state compares revenue across states and the at-sea fishery as a percentage of total revenue. This metric is only calculated for catcher vessels.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Ex-vessel revenue is obtained from fish ticket data maintained by PacFIN.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Data are grouped by state to determine revenue by state, divided by total ex-vessel revenue, and multiplied by 100 to get the percentage of revenue by state.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Unlike most other metrics, Share of landings by state is not summarized as mean, median, or total; it is visualized with a separate line for each state.
        </p>
    </div>

    <a href = "#othergini"></a>
    <div id = "othergini">
        <h3>Gini coefficient</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Gini coefficient provides a measure of revenue equality, and ranges from zero (perfect equality, where everyone receives an equal share) to one (perfect inequality, where one recipient receives all of the shares; PFMC and NMFS 2017, Table 4). A higher Gini coefficient over time indicates that revenue concentration is increasing.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The Gini coefficient is calculated for all sectors. For vessels, we use ex-vessel revenue from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN and NORPAC. For processors, we use revenue reported on the EDC forms.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            We use the Gini function in R to estimate the Gini coefficient. Gini is estimated by determining the Lorenz curve (distribution of revenue) and subtracting the area under the Lorenz curve from the area under the line of equality (0.5) divided by the area under the line of equality, or essentially double the area between the Lorenz curve and the line of equality.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Mean, median, and total statistics do not apply to Gini coefficient.
        </p>
    </div>

    <a href = "#otherseasonality"></a>
    <div id = "otherseasonality">
        <h3>Seasonality</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            It was expected that the additional flexibility associated with catch shares would change the timing of landings. This metric summarizes the timing of landings by reporting the day of the year upon which 50% of that year’s total catch was landed.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Seasonality is calculated for catcher vessels, motherships, and catcher–processors using ex-vessel revenue from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN and NORPAC.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            We summarize landings weight by day of year, and then calculate the cumulative totals for each day. The day of the year where the cumulative total is 50% of the annual total is then reported.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Mean, median, and total statistics do not apply to Seasonality. This metric is meant to provide a broad overview of the timing of fisheries; for more in-depth information, the NWFSC Landings Tracker is available in Fisheye.
        </p>
    </div>

    <a href = "#otherproductionprocessed"></a>
    <div id = "otherproductionprocessed">
        <h3>Percentage of production processed</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Shorebased processors sell both processed and unprocessed products. This metric summarizes the percentage of processed seafood products (i.e., not recorded as unprocessed) sold, and provides an indication of processing operations within this sector.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms require processors to report production weight by product type. See Number of species processed (Measures of Specialization) for a list of product types by species.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            For this metric, all production listed as any product type other than “Unprocessed” is considered processed products. Production weight of processed products is divided by total production weight of all products (processed and unprocessed), and multiplied by 100. This metric is reported as processor averages (mean and median); total percentage of production processed is not reported.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            The product type Fresh (used in 2009–10) was renamed Processed Fresh from 2011 onward; this may have influenced what respondents include in this category. It is counted as a processed product type for this metric.
        </p>
    </div>

    <a href = "#othernonvessel"></a>
    <div id = "othernonvessel">
        <h3>Percentage of purchases from non-vessel sources</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Some processors purchase fish from non-vessel sources, in addition to vessel sources. This metric summarizes the percentage of fish inputs purchased from non-vessel sources, which can include first receivers, processors, wholesale dealers, brokers, and aquaculture producers.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            EDC forms require processors to report purchases by source, including limited entry trawl vessels, limited entry fixed gear vessels, other vessels, and non-vessel sources.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Purchase weight of non-vessel-sourced fish is divided by total purchase weight of all fish inputs, and multiplied by 100. This metric is reported for the average processor (mean and median) and for the sector as a whole (total).
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            This metric is not available for 2009 and 2010, as non-vessel sources were not explicitly requested on the EDC forms in those years.
        </p>
    </div>

    <a href = "#othertrips"></a>
    <div id = "othertrips">
        <h3>Trips</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Trips is another measure of effort, and is a common unit of analysis. In some cases, trips may be preferred over days at sea because the Trips metric does not include the uncertainty associated with self-reporting days at sea.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Data are obtained from PacFIN.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            For each vessel, trips are summed by fishery to yield the number of trips. Trips are summarized as vessel averages (mean and median) and fleetwide totals.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Currently this metric is not provided for motherships or catcher–processors.
