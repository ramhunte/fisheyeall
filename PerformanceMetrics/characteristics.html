<h1>Processor/Vessel Characteristics</h1>

    <a href = "#descnumber"></a>
    <div id = "descnumber">
    <h2>Number of vessels and number of processors</h1>
    <p><b>Purpose:</b>
        The number of participants is reported, both to monitor for changes in participation and to provide context for other metrics (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.1.1(b)(1)). 
        Filters are also provided to show how the number of participants varies by fishery, operation size, and location.
    </p>
    <p><b>Data:</b>
        The number of vessels participating in the catch share program is obtained from state fish tickets for the shorebased sector and from the North Pacific (NORPAC) database 
        for the at-sea sectors. The number of processors participating in the catch share program is obtained from state fish tickets and EDC data. There is no record of processing 
        operations outside of EDC data; therefore, whether or not a company processes fish is determined using fish production information provided by companies on their EDC submissions.
    </p>
    <p><b>Method:</b>
        The total number of participants is reported for all sectors. The number of vessels is reported for the catcher vessel, mothership, and catcher–processor sectors, and the number of 
        companies is reported for shorebased processors. A vessel is counted as a participant if it made at least one delivery within the fishery being reported. See Fishery and Production 
        Activity Designations for a description of how fisheries are defined and how vessels are designated to a fishery. A processor is counted as a participant of the catch share program 
        for a given survey year if: 1) state fish tickets indicate it received at least one catch share delivery of more than 1,000 lb of groundfish (including whiting), and 2) EDC data indicate 
        the processing of groundfish or whiting. Processing of groundfish or whiting is determined by whether EDC data indicate processed product types (i.e., listed as product type other than Unprocessed) 
        and communication with the participant does not indicate otherwise.
    </p>
    <p><b>Caveats:</b>
        Some operations own multiple vessels. Analyzing the performance of sets of operations is outside of the scope of the current analysis. For processors, the unit of analysis is the FRSL owner (or company), 
        which takes into account how businesses self-identify their operations. For license owners with multiple site licenses under the same company name, data are aggregated together. FRSLs under different 
        company names that are linked by a broader corporate ownership are not grouped together as a single company.

    <div id = "vesselattributes">
    <h2>Vessel attributes</h1>
    <p><b>Metrics included:</b>Vessel length, Vessel fuel capacity, Vessel horsepower</p>
    <p><b>Purpose:</b>
        The following suite of metrics captures characteristics of a vessel that contribute to operational capacity. Changes in fuel capacity, horsepower, and length may indicate improvements to vessel efficiency 
        or ability to catch fish.
    </p>
    <p><b>Data:</b>
        EDC forms request vessels to report the fuel capacity, horsepower, and length of the vessel for catcher vessels, motherships, and catcher–processors.
    </p>
    <p><b>Method:</b>
        The following metrics are used as reported in the forms, and summarized as vessel averages (mean and median). Total is only reported for vessel fuel capacity.
        <li>Vessel fuel capacity (gallons)</li>
        <li>Vessel horsepower</li>
        <li>Vessel length (feet)</li>
    </p>
    <p><b>Caveats:</b>
        Changes in these metrics can be the result of physical changes made to vessels or changes in the composition of vessels participating.
    </p>
    </div>

    <a href ="#descvalue"></a>
    <div id = "descvalue">
    <h2>Vessel market value and Vessel replacement value</h1>
    <p><b>Purpose:</b>
        Vessel market and vessel replacement values provide information about a company’s physical assets. 
    </p>
    <p><b>Data:</b>
        EDC forms request the market and replacement values of the vessel related to the most recent marine survey.
    </p>
    <p><b>Methods:</b>
        The following metrics are used as-reported in the forms and summarized as vessel averages (mean and median); total values are not reported.
        <li>Vessel market value</li>
        <li>Vessel replacement value</li>
    </p>
    <p><b>Caveats:</b>
        A small number of vessels include the values of permits, quota, and fishing gear in the market and replacement values. Increases in market value 
        can indicate that existing vessels have invested in vessel improvements and/or that newer/more-valuable vessels have entered the fishery. 
        Differences in replacement value and market value may indicate that vessels in the fleet are aging and improvements are not keeping pace with depreciation.
        </p>
    <p>For processors, the EDC form requests information on market value and replacement value of facilities based on the most recent appraisal. However, we do not 
        report these values, as very few processors provide non-n/a responses. This may in part be due to lease arrangements between the processing company and the 
        owners of the facilities where they are located.

<h1>Measures of Specialization</h1>

<a href = "#descfisheries"></a>
<div id = "descfisheries">
    <h2>Number of fisheries</h2>
    <p><b>Purpose:</b>
        The Number of fisheries metric, as well as Revenue diversification (described below), may be used to track trends in fishery participation. See Number of species 
        processed and Number of species sold for the processor equivalent of this metric. This metric is not calculated for the mothership and catcher–processor sectors, 
        as whiting is the only fishery these sectors participate in on the U.S. West Coast.
    </p>
<p><b>Data:</b>
    Ex-vessel revenue is obtained from EDC data; fish tickets are maintained by PacFIN. The EDC Program categorizes trips by fishery (see Fishery and Production Activity Designations).
</p>
<p><b>Methods:</b>
    For each vessel, the number of fisheries is calculated by counting the number of fisheries where revenue was greater than zero, and is reported as the mean or median across all vessels. 
    The fleetwide total is not reported for this metric.
</p>
<p><b>Caveats:</b>
    This metric does not consider the amount of participation within each fishery. For instance, if a vessel earned 98% of its revenue from crab and 2% from groundfish fixed gear with trawl 
    endorsement, the number of fisheries would still be two.
</p>
<p><b>Fisheye:</b>
    Any fishing in Alaska is counted as one additional fishery for each vessel that fishes in Alaska.
</p>
</div>

<a href = "#descdiversity"></a>
<div id = "descdiversity">
    <h2>Revenue diversification</h2>
    <p><b>Purpose:</b>
        This metric provides similar information to the Number of fisheries metric described above, but it also takes into account how much the vessel participates in each 
        fishery or how much each species contributes to the total production value for the processor. This metric is not calculated for the mothership and catcher–processor sectors, 
        as whiting is the only fishery these sectors participate in on the U.S. West Coast.
    </p>
    <p><b>Data:</b>
        For catcher vessels, ex-vessel revenue is aggregated to the vessel–fishery–year level from fish tickets and EDC forms. For processors, species- (or species group-)level 
        production values are obtained from EDC forms.
    </p>
    <p><b>Methods:</b>
        The Effective Shannon Index (ESI; Equation 1) is calculated for each individual (vessel or processor) by first calculating the individual proportions (pf) of revenue (Rf)
        for each component of their operation (f). The ESI for each vessel or processor is the exponentiated negative sum of the product of the proportions of revenue (pf) for each
        fishery (f) and the log proportions ln(pf). The ESI is calculated for each vessel or processor and summarized as mean and median; total is not calculated.
    </p>
    <p>
        $$p_{f} = {R_{f} \over \Sigma_{f=1}^{F}R_f}$$
    </p>
    <p>
        $$ESI = e^{- \Sigma p_{f}lnp_{f}}$$
    </p>
    <p><b>Caveats:</b>
        Fishery or species groupings used in this calculation differ for vessels and processors. The ESI is calculated for catcher vessels by fishery, whereas processors use the 
        species or species groups as collected on the EDC processor form (see Fishery and Production Activity Designations). This metric emphasizes the effective number of fisheries 
        or species relied on for revenue. (The number of species processed is also reported in a separate metric.) If the number of fisheries (or number of species processed) is 
        higher than the ESI, it indicates that individual operations within the sector rely more on certain fisheries (species) for revenue than others. If the ESI is the same as 
        the number of fisheries, then the operations rely evenly on all of the fisheries.
    </p>
    <p><b>Fisheye:</b>
        An annual ESI is calculated for each vessel or processor. The filters only determine which vessels/processors are included in the statistic—not which parts of their operations). 
        For the purposes of Fisheye, all Alaska participation is 
        treated as one fishery.
    </p>

<a href = "#desccsrevenue"></a>
<div id = "desccsrevenue">
    <h2>Proportion of total ex-vessel revenue (or landings) from catch share fishery</h2>
    <p><b>Purpose:</b>
        Catch share management was expected to lead to increased fishery specialization. The Proportion of ex-vessel revenue (or landings) from the catch share fishery metric monitors vessel 
        revenue (or landings weight) from catch shares relative to other fisheries, and may indicate specialization (or lack thereof). Proportion of ex-vessel revenue is reported for catcher 
        vessels; proportion of landings is reported for the mothership and catcher–processor sectors.
    </p>
    <p><b>Data:</b>
        Ex-vessel revenue and landings weight are obtained from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN. The EDC forms require motherships and catcher–processors to report landings weight on the U.S. 
        West Coast and Alaska.
    </p>
    <p><b>Methods:</b>
        This metric is calculated using landings weight (catcher–processors, motherships) and ex-vessel revenue (catcher vessels). Revenue or landings weight from the catch share fishery are 
        compared to the vessel’s total revenue or catch/purchase weight, and summarized as vessel averages (mean and median; Equation 2).
    </p>
    <p>
        $$Proportion_{cs} = {R_{cs} \over R_{cs} + R_{other} + R_{ak}}$$
    </p>
    <p><b>Caveats:</b>
    None.
</p>
<p><b>Fisheye:</b>
    Note as of 2025-03-07: The Alaska toggle button was removed, Alaska is included in the denominator for the calculation. See "Proportion of WC ex-vessel revenue from catch share fishery" 
    for this statistic without Alaska revenue.

<h2>Proportion of WC ex-vessel revenue (or landings) from catch share fishery</h2>
<p><b>Purpose:</b>
    Catch share management was expected to lead to increased fishery specialization. The Proportion of ex-vessel revenue (or landings) from the catch share fishery metric monitors vessel 
    revenue (or landings weight) from catch shares relative to other fisheries, and may indicate specialization (or lack thereof). Proportion of ex-vessel revenue is reported for catcher 
    vessels; proportion of landings is reported for the mothership and catcher–processor sectors.
</p>
<p><b>Data:</b>
    Ex-vessel revenue and landings weight are obtained from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN. The EDC forms require motherships and catcher–processors to report landings weight on the U.S. 
    West Coast and Alaska.
</p>
<p><b>Methods:</b>
    This metric is calculated using landings weight (catcher–processors, motherships) and ex-vessel revenue (catcher vessels). Revenue or landings weight from the catch share fishery are 
    compared to the vessel’s total revenue or catch/purchase weight, and summarized as vessel averages (mean and median; Equation 2).
</p>
<p>
    $$Proportion_{cs} = {R_{cs} \over R_{cs} + R_{other}}$$
</p>
<p><b>Caveats:</b>
None.

<p><b>Fisheye:</b>
Note as of 2025-03-07: The Alaska toggle button was removed, Alaska is not included in the denominator for the calculation. See "Proportion of total ex-vessel revenue from catch share fishery"

<a href = "#descprocessed"></a>
<div id = "descprocessed">
    <h2>Number of species processed</h2>
    <p><b>Purpose:</b>
        The number of species processed offers insight into the production activities and product diversification of processors.
    </p>
    <p><b>Data:</b>
        EDC forms require processors to report production revenue by species and product type. Fishery and Production Activity Designations describes the list of species requested on the 
        EDC forms. For most species on the EDC form, product types include Processed Fresh, Frozen, Unprocessed, and Other. For the following species, Canned is also listed as a product 
        type: coastal pelagics, crab, shrimp, sturgeon, and tuna. For salmon, Canned and Smoked are also listed as product types. For Pacific whiting, product types include Surimi, H&G/HGT 
        (headed and gutted/headed, gutted, tail off), Fillets, Roe, Frozen whole, Unprocessed, and Other.
    </p>
    <p><b>Methods:</b>
        The number of unique species sold as a type of processed product are counted for each processor and summarized as the mean or median. Processed product types are defined as any 
        product type other than unprocessed. The total number of species processed represents the total number of unique species processed across processors.
    </p>
    <p><b>Caveats:</b>
        The product type Fresh (used in 2009–10) was renamed Processed Fresh from 2011 onward; this may have influenced what respondents include in this category (e.g., whole round 
        unprocessed products may have been included under Fresh in 2009–10). It is counted as a processed product type for this metric. This metric does not consider the amount of 
        product or product value generated by each species. For instance, if 90% of a processor’s processed products are whiting and 10% are rockfish, the number of species processed 
        would still be two. The EDC form requests production information for 24 species/species groups (see Fishery and Production Activity Designations for full list), so the total 
        number of species sold is subject to these groupings and therefore the maximum value is 24. This information is not reported for catcher–processors or motherships, because 
        they only process one species.
    </p>
</div>

<a href = "#descsold"></a>
<div id = "descsold">
    <h2>Number of species sold</h2>
    <p><b>Purpose:</b>
        The number of species sold offers insight into the production activities and product diversification of processors.
    </p>
    <p><b>Data:</b>
        EDC forms require processors to report production revenue by species. Fishery and Production Activity Designations describes 
        the list of species requested on the EDC forms.
    </p>
    <p><b>Methods:</b>
        The number of species sold is counted for each processor and summarized as the mean or median. The total number of species sold represents the total number of unique species sold across 
        processors. Unlike Number of species processed, this metric includes all seafood products, processed or unprocessed.
    </p>
    <p><b>Caveats:</b>
        This metric does not consider the amount of product or product value generated by each species. The EDC form requests production information for 24 species/species groups (see Fishery 
        and Production Activity Designations for full list), so the total number of species sold is subject to these groupings and therefore the maximum value is 24. The EDC form requests 
        processors report production for all products made or acquired in that fiscal year, not necessarily sold; therefore, inventories from previous years are not included, while products 
        held in inventory at the end of the fiscal year to be sold at a later date are included.
    </p>

<a href = "#descproduction"></a>
<div id = "descproduction">
    <h2>Proportion of production value from groundfish</h2>
    <p><b>Purpose:</b>
        This is a measure of dependence on groundfish species, including whiting, for
        overall processor production revenue.
    </p>
    <p><b>Data:</b>
        EDC forms require processors to report production revenue by species.
        Fishery and Production Activity Designations describes the list of species requested on the EDC forms.
    </p>
    <p><b>Methods:</b>
        Production value for all groundfish species (including whiting) is compared to the total production value for all species. Proportions are calculated per processor and summarized as 
        processor averages (mean, Equation 3, and median). Proportions are also calculated for the overall sector, by summing the numerator and denominator across all processors (total, Equation 4).
    </p>
    <p>
        $$Mean = {1 \over N}{\Sigma_{i=1}^N}p_{i}$$
    </p>
    <p>
        $$p_{i} = {{\Sigma_{s\in{G}}Rev_{is}} \over {\Sigma_{s\in{L}}Rev_{is}}}$$
    </p>
    <p>
        where G = set of all groundfish species groups, including whiting, listed on EDC form, and L = set of all species groups listed on EDC form, including all groundfish species.
    </p>
    <p>
        $$Total = {{{\Sigma_{i=1}^N}{\Sigma_{s\in{G}}}Rev_{is}} \over {{\Sigma_{i=1}^N}{\Sigma_{s\in{L}}}Rev_{is}}}$$
    </p>
    <p><b>Caveats:</b>
        The production value for groundfish species may include groundfish from fisheries outside the catch share program (i.e., open access, limited entry fixed gear, primary sablefish, and tribal); 
        however, the average volume of non-catch share groundfish purchases is small relative to catch share purchases (7% of purchase volumes on average from 2009 to 2018; PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.1). 
        The total production value includes production of all seafood, including shellfish, aquaculture, and imported products.

</div>

<a href = "#descfillet"></a>
<div id = "descfillet">
    <h2>Number of processors who fillet non-whiting groundfish</h2>
    <p><b>Purpose:</b>
        This metric tracks the number of processors that fillet non-whiting groundfish as an indicator of potential changes in groundfish processing operations.
    </p>
    <p><b>Data:</b>
        Beginning in 2017, the EDC forms required processors to report if the facility filleted non-whiting groundfish.
    </p>
    <p><b>Methods:</b>
        Count of the number of processors that report that their operation fillets non-whiting groundfish. This metric is only presented as a total.
    </p>
    <p><b>Caveats:</b>
        The EDC form only requires processors to report whether a facility does or does not fillet some non-whiting groundfish species. This metric is not able to detect changes in which species are filleted, 
        the quantity that is filleted, or what portion of filleted groundfish is sold as fresh or frozen. Changes in this metric can be the result of changes made within processors or changes in the composition 
        of processors participating. This metric is not available prior to 2017.
