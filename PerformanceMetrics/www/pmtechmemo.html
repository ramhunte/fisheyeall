        <h2>Number of vessels and number of processors</h1>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            The number of participants is reported, both to monitor for changes in participation and to provide context for other metrics (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.1.1(b)(1)). 
            Filters are also provided to show how the number of participants varies by fishery, operation size, and location.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The number of vessels participating in the catch share program is obtained from state fish tickets for the shorebased sector and from the North Pacific (NORPAC) database 
            for the at-sea sectors. The number of processors participating in the catch share program is obtained from state fish tickets and EDC data. There is no record of processing 
            operations outside of EDC data; therefore, whether or not a company processes fish is determined using fish production information provided by companies on their EDC submissions.
        </p>
        <p><b>Method:</b>
            The total number of participants is reported for all sectors. The number of vessels is reported for the catcher vessel, mothership, and catcher–processor sectors, and the number of 
            companies is reported for shorebased processors. A vessel is counted as a participant if it made at least one delivery within the fishery being reported. See Fishery and Production 
            Activity Designations for a description of how fisheries are defined and how vessels are designated to a fishery. A processor is counted as a participant of the catch share program 
            for a given survey year if: 1) state fish tickets indicate it received at least one catch share delivery of more than 1,000 lb of groundfish (including whiting), and 2) EDC data indicate 
            the processing of groundfish or whiting. Processing of groundfish or whiting is determined by whether EDC data indicate processed product types (i.e., listed as product type other than Unprocessed) 
            and communication with the participant does not indicate otherwise.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Some operations own multiple vessels. Analyzing the performance of sets of operations is outside of the scope of the current analysis. For processors, the unit of analysis is the FRSL owner (or company), 
            which takes into account how businesses self-identify their operations. For license owners with multiple site licenses under the same company name, data are aggregated together. FRSLs under different 
            company names that are linked by a broader corporate ownership are not grouped together as a single company.

        <h2>Vessel attributes</h2>
        

        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>Vessel length, Vessel fuel capacity, Vessel horsepower</p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            The following suite of metrics captures characteristics of a vessel that contribute to operational capacity. Changes in fuel capacity, horsepower, and length may indicate improvements to vessel efficiency 
            or ability to catch fish.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            EDC forms request vessels to report the fuel capacity, horsepower, and length of the vessel for catcher vessels, motherships, and catcher–processors.
        </p>
        <p><b>Method:</b>
            The following metrics are used as reported in the forms, and summarized as vessel averages (mean and median). Total is only reported for vessel fuel capacity.
            <li>Vessel fuel capacity (gallons)</li>
            <li>Vessel horsepower</li>
            <li>Vessel length (feet)</li>
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Changes in these metrics can be the result of physical changes made to vessels or changes in the composition of vessels participating.

        <div id = "descvalue">
        <h2>Vessel market value and Vessel replacement value</h2>
        

        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Vessel market and vessel replacement values provide information about a company’s physical assets. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            EDC forms request the market and replacement values of the vessel related to the most recent marine survey.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The following metrics are used as-reported in the forms and summarized as vessel averages (mean and median); total values are not reported.
            <li>Vessel market value</li>
            <li>Vessel replacement value</li>
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            A small number of vessels include the values of permits, quota, and fishing gear in the market and replacement values. Increases in market value 
            can indicate that existing vessels have invested in vessel improvements and/or that newer/more-valuable vessels have entered the fishery. 
            Differences in replacement value and market value may indicate that vessels in the fleet are aging and improvements are not keeping pace with depreciation.
            </p>
        <p>For processors, the EDC form requests information on market value and replacement value of facilities based on the most recent appraisal. However, we do not 
            report these values, as very few processors provide non-n/a responses. This may in part be due to lease arrangements between the processing company and the 
            owners of the facilities where they are located.

        <h2>Number of fisheries</h2>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            The Number of fisheries metric, as well as Revenue diversification (described below), may be used to track trends in fishery participation. See Number of species 
            processed and Number of species sold for the processor equivalent of this metric. This metric is not calculated for the mothership and catcher–processor sectors, 
            as whiting is the only fishery these sectors participate in on the U.S. West Coast.
        </p>
    <p><b>Data:</b>
        Ex-vessel revenue is obtained from EDC data; fish tickets are maintained by PacFIN. The EDC Program categorizes trips by fishery (see Fishery and Production Activity Designations).
    </p>
    <p><b>Methods:</b>
        For each vessel, the number of fisheries is calculated by counting the number of fisheries where revenue was greater than zero, and is reported as the mean or median across all vessels. 
        The fleetwide total is not reported for this metric.
    </p>
    <p><b>Caveats:</b>
        This metric does not consider the amount of participation within each fishery. For instance, if a vessel earned 98% of its revenue from crab and 2% from groundfish fixed gear with trawl 
        endorsement, the number of fisheries would still be two.
    </p>
    <p><b>Fisheye:</b>
       Participation in fisheries in Alaska is counted as one additional fishery for each vessel that fishes in Alaska.
    </p>
    </div>

    <a href = "#descdiversity"></a>
    <div id = "descdiversity">
        <h2>Revenue diversification</h2>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            This metric provides similar information to the Number of fisheries metric described above, but it also takes into account how much the vessel participates in each 
            fishery or how much each species contributes to the total production value for the processor. This metric is not calculated for the mothership and catcher–processor sectors, 
            as whiting is the only fishery these sectors participate in on the U.S. West Coast.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            For catcher vessels, ex-vessel revenue is aggregated to the vessel–fishery–year level from fish tickets and EDC forms. For processors, species- (or species group-)level 
            production values are obtained from EDC forms.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The Effective Shannon Index (ESI; Equation 1) is calculated for each individual (vessel or processor) by first calculating the individual proportions (pf) of revenue (Rf)
            for each component of their operation (f). The ESI for each vessel or processor is the exponentiated negative sum of the product of the proportions of revenue (pf) for each
            fishery (f) and the log proportions ln(pf). The ESI is calculated for each vessel or processor and summarized as mean and median; total is not calculated.
        </p>
        <p>
            $$p_{f} = {R_{f} \over \Sigma_{f=1}^{F}R_f}$$
        </p>
        <p>
            $$ESI = e^{- \Sigma p_{f}lnp_{f}}$$
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Fishery or species groupings used in this calculation differ for vessels and processors. The ESI is calculated for catcher vessels by fishery, whereas processors use the 
            species or species groups as collected on the EDC processor form (see Fishery and Production Activity Designations). This metric emphasizes the effective number of fisheries 
            or species relied on for revenue. (The number of species processed is also reported in a separate metric.) If the number of fisheries (or number of species processed) is 
            higher than the ESI, it indicates that individual operations within the sector rely more on certain fisheries (species) for revenue than others. If the ESI is the same as 
            the number of fisheries, then the operations rely evenly on all of the fisheries.
        </p>
        <p><b>Fisheye:</b>
            An annual ESI is calculated for each vessel or processor. The filters only determine which vessels/processors are included in the statistic—not which parts of their operations. 
            For the purposes of Fisheye, all Alaska participation is 
            treated as one fishery.

    <h2>Proportion of total ex-vessel revenue (or landings) from catch share fishery</h2>
    <p><b>Purpose:</b>
        Catch share management was expected to lead to increased fishery specialization. The Proportion of ex-vessel revenue (or landings) from the catch share fishery metric monitors vessel 
        revenue (or landings weight) from catch shares relative to other fisheries, and may indicate specialization (or lack thereof). Proportion of ex-vessel revenue is reported for catcher 
        vessels; proportion of landings is reported for the mothership and catcher–processor sectors.
    </p>
    <p><b>Data:</b>
        Ex-vessel revenue and landings weight are obtained from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN. The EDC forms require motherships and catcher–processors to report landings weight on the U.S. 
        West Coast and Alaska.
    </p>
    <p><b>Methods:</b>
        This metric is calculated using landings weight (catcher–processors, motherships) and ex-vessel revenue (catcher vessels). Revenue or landings weight from the catch share fishery are 
        compared to the vessel’s total revenue or catch/purchase weight, and summarized as vessel averages (mean and median; Equation 2).

        <h2>Number of species processed</h2>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            The number of species processed offers insight into the production activities and product diversification of processors.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            EDC forms require processors to report production revenue by species and product type. Fishery and Production Activity Designations describes the list of species requested on the 
            EDC forms. For most species on the EDC form, product types include Processed Fresh, Frozen, Unprocessed, and Other. For the following species, Canned is also listed as a product 
            type: coastal pelagics, crab, shrimp, sturgeon, and tuna. For salmon, Canned and Smoked are also listed as product types. For Pacific whiting, product types include Surimi, H&G/HGT 
            (headed and gutted/headed, gutted, tail off), Fillets, Roe, Frozen whole, Unprocessed, and Other.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The number of unique species sold as a type of processed product are counted for each processor and summarized as the mean or median. Processed product types are defined as any 
            product type other than unprocessed. The total number of species processed represents the total number of unique species processed across processors.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            The product type Fresh (used in 2009–10) was renamed Processed Fresh from 2011 onward; this may have influenced what respondents include in this category (e.g., whole round 
            unprocessed products may have been included under Fresh in 2009–10). It is counted as a processed product type for this metric. This metric does not consider the amount of 
            product or product value generated by each species. For instance, if 90% of a processor’s processed products are whiting and 10% are rockfish, the number of species processed 
            would still be two. The EDC form requests production information for 24 species/species groups (see Fishery and Production Activity Designations for full list), so the total 
            number of species sold is subject to these groupings and therefore the maximum value is 24. This information is not reported for catcher–processors or motherships, because 
            they only process one species.

        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            The number of species sold offers insight into the production activities and product diversification of processors.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            EDC forms require processors to report production revenue by species. Fishery and Production Activity Designations describes 
            the list of species requested on the EDC forms.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The number of species sold is counted for each processor and summarized as the mean or median. The total number of species sold represents the total number of unique species sold across 
            processors. Unlike Number of species processed, this metric includes all seafood products, processed or unprocessed.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            This metric does not consider the amount of product or product value generated by each species. The EDC form requests production information for 24 species/species groups (see Fishery 
            and Production Activity Designations for full list), so the total number of species sold is subject to these groupings and therefore the maximum value is 24. The EDC form requests 
            processors report production for all products made or acquired in that fiscal year, not necessarily sold; therefore, inventories from previous years are not included, while products 
            held in inventory at the end of the fiscal year to be sold at a later date are included.

            This is a measure of dependence on groundfish species, including whiting, for
            overall processor production revenue.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            EDC forms require processors to report production revenue by species.
            Fishery and Production Activity Designations describes the list of species requested on the EDC forms.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Production value for all groundfish species (including whiting) is compared to the total production value for all species. Proportions are calculated per processor and summarized as 
            processor averages (mean, Equation 3, and median). Proportions are also calculated for the overall sector, by summing the numerator and denominator across all processors (total, Equation 4).

        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            The production value for groundfish species may include groundfish from fisheries outside the catch share program (i.e., open access, limited entry fixed gear, primary sablefish, and tribal); 
            however, the average volume of non-catch share groundfish purchases is small relative to catch share purchases (7% of purchase volumes on average from 2009 to 2018; PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.1).

            This metric tracks the number of processors that fillet non-whiting groundfish as an indicator of potential changes in groundfish processing operations.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Beginning in 2017, the EDC forms required processors to report if the facility filleted non-whiting groundfish.

        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            The EDC form only requires processors to report whether a facility does or does not fillet some non-whiting groundfish species. This metric is not able to detect changes in which species are filleted, 
            the quantity that is filleted, or what portion of filleted groundfish is sold as fresh or frozen. Changes in this metric can be the result of changes made within processors or changes in the composition

        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Catch share programs are expected to reduce the number of vessels in the fishery, resulting in less effort and fewer jobs. The total number of crew is reported to monitor these expected impacts, and the number of 
            crew-days provides a measure of effort (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.1.2(a)(3)).
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request the number of days fishing and number of crew positions (crew) by fishery for catcher vessels. Catcher–processors and motherships are required to report the average number of processing crew members 
            and non-processing crew members when operating in the U.S. West Coast whiting fishery. Processing crew includes: line workers, fishmeal crew, quality control, technicians, cleanup, factory managers, mechanics who work 
            on processing equipment, and combis. Non-processing crew includes: captain, deckhands, wheelhouse, galley, and engine room. Catcher–processors and motherships are also required to report the number of days for offloading, 
            steaming, fishing, and/or processing on the U.S. West Coast, steaming between the U.S. West Coast and Alaska, and days at sea for all Alaska fisheries.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            For catcher vessels, the number of crew and crew-days are reported by fishery. For catcher–processors and motherships, we report the number of non-processing and processing crew and crew-days. Crew-days are calculated by 
            multiplying the number of crew for a specific fishery by the number of days fished in that fishery. Data are summarized as vessel averages (mean and median) and fleetwide totals.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            The number of crew is a lower-bound estimate of the number of individuals employed as crew. As reported here, it represents the number of positions on the vessel, excluding captain, and does not take into account turnover or 
            multiple individuals that may fill one position.

            Monitoring the number of employees at shorebased processors provides information about the number of processing jobs (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.1.2(a)(D)).
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request information about the number of production and non-production employees. This information includes full and part-time employees, contract workers, and temporary employees. A production employee is 
            defined as a worker (up through and including the line supervisor level) engaged in fabricating, processing, assembling, inspecting, receiving, packing, warehousing, shipping, maintenance, repair, janitorial, product development, 
            or transporting product on-site. A non-production employee is defined as one involved in supervision above the line supervisor level as well as sales, advertising, credit, collection, installation, cafeteria, recordkeeping, 
            clerical and routine office functions, guard services, executive, purchasing, finance, and legal. For production employees, the EDC form collects the number of production employees and total hours worked for the week that 
            contains the 12th of each month, to capture a weekly snapshot of employment that is assumed to be representative for each month throughout the year. For non-production employees, the EDC form asks for the number of employees 
            and total hours worked for the week that includes 12 March, as non-production employment is assumed to be relatively stable throughout the year.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The following metrics are reported for shorebased processor employee numbers:
            <li><b>Number of non-production employees:</b> Number of non-production employees the week of 12 March, assumed to be representative of the year. This metric is reported for the average processor (mean and median) 
                and for the sector as a whole (total).</li>
            <li><b>Average monthly number of production employees:</b>For each processor, the mean of the number of production workers in each month (as represented by the week of the 12th of each month) is calculated. Data are summarized as processor averages (mean and median) and sectorwide totals. 
                The total represents a sum of the workers employed in an average month across the year for all processors.</li>
            <li><b>Maximum monthly number of production employees:</b>For each processor, the maximum number of production workers of all months (as represented by the week of the 12th of each month) is calculated. Data are summarized as processor averages (mean and median). The total is not calculated.</li>
            </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            There are several limitations to the methods. Given that the data are collected for specific weeks of the year, it may be that a given week is not representative of labor throughout the month and/or year. The number of employees is 
            a lower-bound estimate of the number of individuals employed at processing facilities. As reported here, it represents the number of positions, and does not take into account turnover or multiple individuals that may fill one position 
            over the year. For the sector total average monthly number of production employees, the total is a sum of the number of employees in an average month for each processor; therefore, it may not represent the actual total number of production 
            employees working at any point in the year. If companies have a wide range of employment across months due to seasonality, the average may not be representative of any specific month.
        </p>
        <p><b>Fisheye:</b>
            These metrics are only reported for the production activity All production, as information on number of employees is not requested by species group on the processor EDC form given the potential difficulty of such reporting.

            The EDC forms request information about compensation to individuals on vessels or at shorebased processors. See Number of positions and position-days for full description of the individual labor categories. See the table at the top of this section for a list of which labor categories apply to which sectors. Labor payments include wages, bonuses, benefits, payroll taxes, and unemployment insurance.
        </p>  
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Labor payments are summarized as reported on the EDC form: crew and captain payments are reported for catcher vessels; processing crew and non-processing crew are reported for motherships and catcher–processors; production employees and non-production employees are reported for processors.

        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            To understand processing employee compensation, it is helpful to summarize overall compensation per unit. These metrics provide estimates of compensation per employee for both production and non-production employees of shorebased processors.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request information about the number of production and non-production employees and hours worked, as well as total annual labor expenses by type of employee. For production employees, the EDC form collects the number of production workers and total hours worked for the week that contains the 12th of each month, to capture a snapshot of weekly employment. The week that contains the 12th of each month is assumed to be representative of each week in a given month throughout the year. For non-production employees, the EDC form asks for the number of employees and total hours worked for the week that includes the 12th of March, as non-production employment is assumed to be relatively stable throughout the year.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The following metrics are reported to summarize compensation and wage rates for shorebased processor employees:
            <li><b>Hourly compensation per production employee:</b>
                Average hourly compensation for production workers is calculated by dividing annual labor expenses by an estimate of total annual hours worked. Estimates of total annual hours worked for each processor are calculated by assuming that employment information for the week of the 12th is representative of the entire month, and by weighting each month equally using the formula below. This metric is reported as processor averages (mean and median). Total statistics are also reported, and represent weighted averages.
            </li>
            <li><b>Annual compensation per non-production employee:</b>
                Compensation per non-production employee position is calculated by dividing annual labor expenses by the number of non-production employees in the week containing 12 March, assumed to be representative of the number of positions in all weeks during the year. This metric is reported as processor averages (mean and median); total statistics are not reported.
            </li>
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            To measure annual hours worked, the form asks for the total hours worked by production employees within one week (the week of the 12th) for each month in the year. There are some limitations to this approach, as the given week may not be representative of labor throughout the month. Additionally, each employee is assumed to be compensated equally where, in reality, wage rates may differ by employee. The EDC survey asks for total compensation, which includes wages, bonuses, benefits (including housing), payroll taxes, unemployment insurance, and other forms of compensation; therefore, the wage rates reported also include these forms of compensation.
        </p>
        <p><b>Fisheye:</b>
            These metrics are only reported for the production activity All production, as information on number of employees and hours worked is not requested by species group on the processor EDC form, given the potential difficulty of such reporting.

        <h3>Vessel wage rates</h3>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Captain wage per year, Crew wage per year, Processing crew wage per year, Non-processing crew wage per year, Captain wage per day, Crew wage per day, Processing crew wage per day, Non-processing crew wage per day, Captain wage per dollar revenue, Crew wage per dollar revenue, Processing crew wage per dollar revenue, Non-processing crew wage per dollar revenue
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            To understand captain and crew compensation, it is helpful to summarize overall compensation per unit, e.g., per year, per day, or per dollar of revenue. For instance, crew wage per year is a measure of annual compensation, while crew wage per dollar of revenue is the effective crew share, independent of the share system itself. Crew wage per day provides a standardized rate to compare across operations, because vessels do not operate under a typical 2,080-hour work year.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request information about the total compensation to captain and crew, as well as two pieces of information about the crew share system (costs deducted from ex-vessel revenue and share percentage paid to crew and captain) for catcher vessels. The EDC forms also request the number of days fishing and number of crew by fishery for catcher vessels, and total days spent fishing, steaming, and processing in the U.S. West Coast fishery for motherships and catcher–processors. Ex-vessel revenue is obtained from fish ticket data maintained by PacFIN; at-sea revenue and production value are obtained from the EDC forms. See Number of positions and position-days for full description of the individual labor categories.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            For catcher vessels, the following methods are used for captain and crew, and for catcher–processors and motherships the same methods are applied to both processing and non-processing crew.
            <li><b>Wage per year:</b>
                Total compensation/number of positions.
            </li>
            <li><b>Wage per day:</b>
                Wage per year/number of days fishing.
            </li>
            <li><b>Wage per dollar revenue:</b>
                Wage per year/ex-vessel revenue.
            </li>
            Crew rates are summarized as vessel averages (mean and median). Total statistics are also reported, and represent weighted averages. For example, total crew wage per day is calculated as the sum of crew wages for all vessels divided by the sum of days at sea for all vessels.
            
            <p>See Cost Metrics for a description of cost allocation for crew and captain wages.</p>
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Crew wage statistics are based on the number of crew positions, which is a lower-bound estimate for the actual number of individuals employed and does not account for turnover. Each crewmember is assumed to be compensated equally. This is also a limitation, because we expect crew with more experience to be paid more. The measure of wage per day likely overestimates the wage per unit effort, because the time spent in shorebased activities such as vessel repairs or bait preparation is not included in the denominator. Lastly, annual crew compensation does not necessarily reflect the total personal income for a given crew member, who may fish on additional vessels or have non-fishing employment.

        <h3>Processing wage per value-added</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            This metric measures return on employee compensation by calculating the proportion of earnings from fish sales that is used to compensate production employees. This demonstrates how the economic inputs of labor are converted into processor value-added. This ratio can be used as an indicator of potentially changing profit margins for processors; if value-added rises, but compensation costs rise more, the ratio will rise, which, all other things equal, likely indicates declining processor profit margins. Selling highly processed products that require extensive skilled labor may increase the value-added, but may also require that a greater proportion of the markup be dedicated to employee compensation. When this ratio decreases, it suggests that either the company has increased its value-added without increasing labor costs, or has found a way to be more efficient with labor.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            This metric is calculated using data provided by processors on EDC forms, including total compensation for production employees, total value of fish production, total cost of fish purchases, custom processing expenses paid by a processor, and total revenue earned by custom processing fish owned by other entities.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The numerator of this ratio is total production employee compensation, taken directly from EDC forms. The denominator of the ratio is value-added, which is calculated by subtracting the cost of all fish purchases from the revenue of all fish production, adjusted for custom processing activities. In this calculation, custom processing values are included, as revenue earned for custom processing fish that is owned by other entities would not be possible without the labor that is included in the numerator. Furthermore, any expenses paid to other companies who custom process fish for a processor would result in fish production revenue without labor expenses, so custom processing expenses must be taken into consideration. This metric is reported as processor averages (mean and median). Total statistics are also reported, and represent weighted averages.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            As mentioned under Number of shorebased processor employees, production employees include employees in a variety of roles, many of which do not directly impact the net value of fish purchases and production.
        </p>

    <div id = "laborproductivity">
        <h3>Revenue per crew-day</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            This metric is a measure of productivity (in terms of revenue generation) of crew. Productivity is related to economic efficiency and shows how economic inputs are converted to outputs. In this case, we measure labor productivity, where the inputs are the number of crew and days fishing, and the output is ex-vessel revenue.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request the number of days fishing and number of crew by fishery. Ex-vessel revenue is obtained from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN, and Alaska/at-sea revenue and production value from the EDC forms.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            This metric is calculated by dividing ex-vessel revenue by the number of crew-days; where crew-days are calculated by multiplying the number of crew for a specific fishery by the number of days fished in that fishery. This metric is reported as vessel averages (mean and median), as well as fleetwide totals. Total revenue per crew-day is a weighted average, and is calculated as total revenue across all vessels divided by total number of crew-days across all vessels.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            This metric should be interpreted as labor productivity in terms of revenue generation, and not productivity in general or total factor productivity. Other measures of productivity would involve additional inputs and outputs.

        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Fishing gear is a major fixed cost incurred by vessels.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request fishing gear costs for fishing gear used in both U.S. West Coast, Alaska, and other fisheries, and fishing gear used only on the U.S. West Coast. In the context of the EDC Program, fishing gear includes the purchases of nets, doors, traps, pots, cables, and fishing machinery used in U.S. West Coast fisheries, as well as repairs or
            maintenance of the fishing gear. Fishing gear that is only used in Alaska is not requested.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Fisheye reports one metric for fishing gear expenses. Fishing gear used in all fisheries and fishing gear used only on the U.S. West Coast are added together after costs are allocated to individual fisheries based on the proportion of revenue in each fishery, annually.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Some vessels do not track fishing gear expenses separately from vessel and on-board equipment costs; therefore, this metric may underestimate fishing gear costs. Fishing gear expenses are different from other costs like fuel or safety equipment, which are likely used for all vessel activities, as fishing gear is likely purchased for a single specific fishery. Data are not available at the fishery level, so costs are allocated proportionally across fisheries. This does result in a misallocation of costs associated with fishery-specific gear.

            Vessel and on-board equipment is a major fixed cost incurred by vessels.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request vessel and on-board equipment costs used in U.S. West Coast, Alaska, and other fisheries. In the context of the EDC Program, vessel and on-board equipment costs include the purchases of electronics, safety equipment, and machinery not used to harvest or process fish, as well as major upgrades, repairs, or maintenance to the vessel or equipment.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Respondents do not provide costs broken out by fishery on the EDC forms. The following cost allocation methods are used to report costs by fishery on Fisheye. For catcher vessels, costs are allocated to fisheries according to the annual proportion of ex-vessel revenue in each fishery. For motherships and catcher–processors, a five-year rolling average of total purchases/catch is used to allocate the costs between U.S. West Coast and Alaska fishing operations. The average proportion is used for motherships and catcher–processors because the proportions can vary greatly by year (depending on the TAC) and would result in large artificial swings in the allocation of fixed costs and, indirectly, swings in total cost net revenue.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Some vessels do not track fishing gear expenses separately from vessel and on-board equipment costs, such that those costs are included in equipment costs; therefore, this metric may overestimate vessel and on-board equipment costs. While the EDC form requests that the purchase of a vessel be included in vessel and on-board equipment costs, this metric excludes vessel purchases in order to provide a better per-vessel annual cost estimate. For catcher vessels, processing equipment is also included in on-board equipment. Processing equipment is reported separately for motherships and catcher–processors.

        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            EDC forms request that motherships and catcher–processors report costs for processing equipment used only on the U.S. West Coast and for equipment shared by U.S. West Coast and all other fisheries. In the context of the EDC forms, processing equipment includes on-board freezers, storage equipment, packing equipment, conveyors, and on-board cargo handling, and does not include equipment, machines, or buildings based primarily on shore. While the EDC forms also request that catcher vessels report any processing equipment used to process or head and gut the fish on board, Processing equipment costs are included in On-board equipment for these vessels because there are so few responses that all of them would be suppressed for confidentiality purposes.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Fisheye reports one metric for processing equipment expenses. Equipment used in all fisheries and equipment used only on the U.S. West Coast are added together after costs are allocated to individual fisheries based on the purchase weight (motherships) or proportion of catch (catcher–processors) on the U.S. West Coast, annually. For motherships and catcher–processors, a five-year rolling average of total purchases/catch is used to allocate the costs between U.S. West Coast and Alaska fishing operations. The average proportion is used for motherships and catcher–processors because the proportions can vary greatly by year depending on the TAC and would result in large artificial swings in the allocation of fixed costs and, indirectly, swings in total cost net revenue.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>

        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms collect information on fixed costs associated with operating a shorebased processor, and each cost category is requested as a separate field. This includes capitalized expenditures on buildings, machinery, and equipment, as well as annual expenses on rental and lease payments and repair and maintenance. Only equipment used to process, transport, or store fish onsite should be included. Processing equipment is defined as all equipment present at this physical location that is used for preparation or packaging of seafood to render it suitable for human consumption, retail sale, industrial uses, or long-term storage, including, but not limited to, cooking, canning, smoking, salting, drying, filleting, freezing, or rendering into meal or oil. Transportation equipment is defined as equipment such as trucks, forklifts, etc., used to transport seafood within the physical location. Storage equipment is defined as equipment present at the physical location for packaging and freezing seafood. Annual expenses on insurance payments are also included in fixed costs.

            <li><b>Buildings:</b>
                Capitalized expenditures on buildings (excluding land but including building improvements), and rental or lease of buildings, job-site trailers, and other structures (including land).
            </li>
            <li><b>Equipment:</b>
                Capitalized expenditures on new and used machinery and equipment, and rental or lease of processing machinery or equipment.
            </li>
            <li><b>Other fixed costs:</b>
                Total expenses on repair and maintenance of facility buildings, machinery, and equipment, and insurance payments (including property, product, personal liability, and fire liability).
            </li>
        </p>
        <p>All fixed costs are allocated to production activity according to the value added for that species group. Not all processors incur expenses for each cost category listed on the EDC form. Only nonzero values are included in summary statistics, and the number of responses indicates the number of processors with nonzero, non-NA values. Number of processors indicates all processors that meet the criterion for a given set of filters.</p>
    <p><b>Caveats:</b>
        The EDC forms do not collect information about financing costs of large purchases and investments, but instead collect the capitalized expenditures or total costs associated with the purchases, repair, maintenance, or improvements. For example, if new equipment is purchased, the total cost of the equipment is reported even though the actual cash outlay, if it were financed, would only be the principal and interest payments. It is likely that many larger capital costs, and perhaps some operating costs, are financed. This would mean that the actual cash outlays in a particular year for those items would be less than what is reported on Fisheye and used in the context of the EDC Program.

        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms request information about the total compensation to individuals on vessels or at shorebased processors. Each sector reports on two categories of compensation, but the categories vary by sector. The two categories for catcher vessels are crew and captain, whereas the categories for motherships, catcher–processors, and shorebased processors are processing and non-processing workers.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The two compensation categories are added together to report total labor costs for each sector. The metrics included in Labor Metrics provide more detailed information about the individual labor categories. Processor labor costs are allocated to production activity according to the value added for that species group.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            All catcher vessels in the catch share program use a crew share system to calculate wages (Steiner et al. 2019). The typical share system is based on a contract where wage is calculated as “crew share net revenue” times the crew share percentage (typically 10–15% per crew member). Crew share net revenue is the ex-vessel revenue received by the vessel minus certain costs. Just as with all other cost categories, EDC participants report total crew wages. In order to report fishery-level wages, total wages are allocated to fisheries by calculating the proportion of “crew share net revenue” in each fishery. Some motherships and catcher–processors use a crew share system, but shorebased processors have never reported using any sort of revenue share system.

        <h3>Fish purchases</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Fish purchases are the single highest variable cost incurred by motherships and shorebased processors.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            EDC forms request the total cost of fish purchases by species, which for motherships includes only Pacific whiting. The list of species available for shorebased processors can be found in Fishery and Production Activity Designations.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Cost of fish purchases is reported by species group and source for shorebased processors (Pacific whiting for motherships). Sources include both vessels as well as non-vessel sources like other processors, first receivers, wholesale dealers, or aquaculture producers.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Although mothership vessels bring non-whiting species on board, the volume is very low and only whiting costs are reported on the EDC forms.

    <div id = "costsfuel">
        <h3>Fuel</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Fuel is always one of the three highest variable costs incurred by vessels.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            EDC forms request vessels to report fuel and lubrication costs for all activities on the U.S. West Coast. Vessels are instructed not to include fuel costs for steaming between the U.S. West Coast and Alaska.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Fuel and lubrication costs for catcher vessels are reported by fishery, and for all U.S. West Coast activities combined for motherships and catcher–processors. Unlike other metrics that use days, revenue, or landings to allocate costs, fuel and lubrication costs are allocated by total gallons used per fishery. Gallons are calculated by multiplying the average fuel use per day by fishery and days at sea by fishery for each vessel. See the metric descriptions for Days at sea and Fuel use per day in Other Metrics for more information.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Changes in fuel costs are the result of fishing conditions, fishing locations, technological change, and global fuel prices.

        <h3>Observers/Electronic monitoring</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            The catch share program requires 100% observer coverage for all at-sea and shorebased catcher vessels (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.4.2(a)(2)). While motherships and catcher–processors have had 100% (or near-100%) coverage since the mid-1970s, catcher vessels had only 14–24% coverage beginning in 2001, until transitioning to 100% with the catch share program (Somers et al. 2017b). To reduce the immediate burden of this cost on industry, NMFS subsidized daily observer coverage fees for catcher vessels; the subsidy gradually decreased from $330 to $0 between 2011 and 2016 (Warlick et al. 2018). Costs such as observer coverage fees, which were introduced with catch shares, were expected to contribute to consolidation and a decrease in profits (Lian et al. 2009). In response to concerns about the cost to industry for observer coverage, electronic monitoring (EM) was introduced as an alternative to observer coverage for catcher vessels. Observer costs are presented to track this new cost in the fishery, particularly per dollar revenue and per day.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC form requests that vessels report observer and/or EM costs associated with fishing on the U.S. West Coast.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            This metric captures both observer and EM costs. Both costs are allocated to fishery by the proportion of days at sea in each fishery. Other U.S. West Coast fisheries do not require observers, and are therefore not allocated observer costs.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Electronic monitoring was piloted through the Exempted Fishing Permit (EFP) program beginning in 2015. 34% of shorebased whiting vessels used EM in 2015, and 42% in 2016 (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.4.2(a)(2)). In 2019, the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) recommended that EM be an option for all midwater trawl vessels in the Pacific whiting fishery and for fixed gear vessels in the Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) fishery beginning in 2021. In 2020, PFMC requested a one-year delay in implementation to develop a mechanism for industry to fund the program. EM fees are structured differently than observer fees. As of 2020, vessels are typically charged a daily rate for observers, whereas for EM there is an initial installation fee, and annual service contracts for technical support and ongoing maintenance estimated at $5,000–$6,000—though some vessels may buy the equipment outright. Additionally, some vessels initially received grants from the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission for EM hardware procurement, which brought the total and averages down as those costs were not reported to the EDC Program. We are unable to report observer and EM costs separately due to confidentiality issues.

        <h3>Shoreside monitoring</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Just as vessels are required to host observers or use electronic monitoring, the catch share program requires 100% catch monitoring coverage, such that shorebased buyers must have a catch monitor to buy fish caught as part of the catch share program (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.4.2(a)(2)). To reduce the immediate burden of this cost on industry, NMFS subsidized the cost of catch monitors at $41/hr with a maximum of $328/day in 2011 and 2012. This subsidy decreased to $27/hr and $216/day in 2014, and $108/day in 2015. From 2016 onward, first receivers have been required to pay the full cost of monitoring.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC form asks processors to report annual total expenditures on catch monitors.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Monitoring costs are allocated to production activity (Pacific whiting or non-whiting groundfish production) by fish purchase weight. Receipt of other species does not require catch monitoring; therefore, no monitoring costs are allocated to other species production.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            There are nonzero values of shoreside monitoring costs prior to catch shares for Pacific whiting activities. In 2009 and 2010, all deliveries of Pacific whiting to a shorebased first receiver were verified by catch monitors, funded entirely by industry.

        <h3>Buyback fees</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            In 2003, 91 vessels fishing in the U.S. West Coast groundfish trawl fishery were purchased through a buyback program to reduce capacity in the fishery. The buyback was financed through a government loan, which continues to be paid back by a 4–5% landings fee on groundfish caught in the catch share program (Holland et al. 2017). Landings fees for crab and shrimp were also initiated to pay for the purchase of crab and shrimp permits associated with the buyback vessels.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Buyback fees are calculated using ex-vessel revenue from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Buyback fees are calculated as a percentage of ex-vessel revenue. Table 3 describes buyback fees by year, state, and fishery group. Each fishery was allocated a share of the initial loan amount. Once the fishery has repaid its portion, the buyback fee is reduced to zero.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Each sector was responsible for paying back a certain portion of the original loan. Dashes in the table above indicate when the loan portion was repaid.

        <h3>Cost recovery fees</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Cost recovery fees are a new cost associated with the transition to catch share management. In 2014, NOAA Fisheries initiated the collection of cost recovery fees—not to exceed 3% of ex-vessel revenue in a given year—from all shorebased and at-sea participants in the catch share fishery, as required under the MSA (Warlick et al. 2018).
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Cost recovery fees are calculated using ex-vessel revenue from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN. Cost recovery rates are determined annually and published in the Federal Register.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Cost recovery fees are calculated as a percentage of ex-vessel revenue. According to the Federal Register, cost recovery fees range from 2.88% to 3.00% for shoreside landings; 0% to 2.50% for motherships; and 0% to 1.10% for catcher–processors.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            There are many years when catcher–processors and catcher vessels in the mothership fishery are not required to pay cost recovery fees because the fees collected in a previous year exceeded the direct program costs for the year of the collection.

        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            For catcher vessels, communications, food, ice, and other supplies are allocated to individual fisheries by days at sea. Bait, offloading fees, and trucking are allocated by delivery weight. Fishing association, travel, and license fees are allocated by ex-vessel revenue. Once allocated, the categories are summed for each vessel before calculating performance metric statistics.

        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Variable costs incurred by processors vary with the level of fish production at facilities, and generally include items such as production and cleaning supplies, additives, and utilities. Labor, fish purchases, and shoreside monitoring costs are also variable costs collected on the EDC form; they are described separately, under the metrics Labor, Fish purchases, and Shoreside monitoring.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms collect information on variable costs associated with operating a shorebased processor. Each cost category is requested as a separate field, although some cost categories are combined for reporting. In general, the EDC forms aim to collect costs that are directly related to facility maintenance and processing operations and not costs that are related to activities or equipment beyond the facility (one exception is Offsite freezing and storage).
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The following metrics summarize variable costs incurred by shorebased processors:
            <li><b>Additives:</b>
                Expenses on additives and non-fish ingredients. Additive costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the value added for the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Electricity:</b>
                Utility expenses on electricity. Electricity costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the fish input weight of the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Freight and trucking:</b>
                This metric combines two cost categories on the EDC form: freight costs for supplies (excluding fish) delivered to the facility, and trucking of fish to the facility. Freight and trucking costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the value added for the associated species group. Outbound freight and trucking costs are not included on the EDC forms.
            </li>
            <li><b>Gas:</b>
                This metric combines three cost categories on the form: natural gas, propane gas for transportation and processing, and other gas (not gasoline). Natural gas costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the fish input weight of the associated species group. Propane gas costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the value added for the associated species group. Other gas costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the fish output weight of the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Offloading:</b>
                Offloading expenses paid to other facilities for their services. Offloading costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the fish input weight of the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Offsite freezing and storage:</b>
                Expenses on offsite product freezing and storage. It is the only cost category related to activities beyond the facility. Offsite freezing and storage costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the value added for the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Packing materials:</b>
                Expenses on packing materials. Packing material costs are allocated to production activity proportional to to the value added for the associated species group.

            <li><b>Production supplies:</b>
                Expenses on production supplies, including boots, smocks, hairnets, and knives. Production supply costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the value added for the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Taxes:</b>
                Expenses on taxes, including property or excise taxes. Tax costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the fish output weight of the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Waste and byproduct disposal:</b>
                Expenses on sewer, waste, and byproduct disposal. Waste and byproduct disposal costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the fish input weight of the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Water:</b>
                Utility expenses on water. Water costs are allocated to production activity proportional to the value added for the associated species group.
            </li>
            <li><b>Other variable costs:</b>
                This metric combines all remaining variable costs collected on the EDC form, including licensing fees, cleaning and custodial supplies, and communications and office supplies for the facility, which are all allocated to production activity proportional to the value added for the associated species group. This metric also includes expenses for custom processing of fish owned by a processor that was performed by another processor outside of this facility, which are collected separately for each production activity and therefore are already allocated.
            </li>

        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Ex-vessel revenue is obtained from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN, and Alaska revenue, at-sea ex-vessel revenue, and production value from the EDC forms. EDC forms require shorebased processors to report revenue from seafood sales (by species group and product type) as well as revenue from offloading, custom processing, and insurance settlements. EDC forms for the mothership and catcher–processor sectors include production revenue by product type.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Ex-vessel revenue is summarized for catcher vessels for all fisheries they participate in. Total production revenue is summarized for motherships and catcher–processors for production in the whiting fishery. Total revenue is summarized for processors and is also reported for the following components of total revenue:
            <li><b>Seafood sales revenue:</b>
                Total value of fish products that were made or acquired within the survey fiscal year.
            </li>

            Fishing revenue and seafood sales represent the majority of revenue for catcher vessels, and motherships and catcher–processors, respectively; however, vessels may also generate revenue from other sources, such as the sale and lease of quota, chartering, or insurance settlements. Currently, other sources of revenue for vessels are not included here. For processors, the EDC form also provides a field to write in any other revenue not specified on the form; however, for analytical consistency across processors, that revenue is not included here.

Proprietary income is calculated based on revenue from fish tickets and the EDC forms minus EDC-reported expenditures. Multipliers for employment and income are obtained from IO-PAC.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Economic contributions are calculated by combining costs allocated to individual fisheries (see Cost Allocation) and ex-vessel revenue with IO-PAC multipliers to calculate total U.S. West Coast employment and income impacts:
        </p>
        <p>
            $$Vessel\,employment\,impacts = {{\Sigma}_{c=1}^{n}C_{c}m_{c}^{E}+Pm_{p}^{E}+Crew+1}$$
        </p>
        <p>Total Employment impacts for each vessel includes the indirect/induced employment (\(E\)) impacts (\(C_{c}m_{c}^{E}\)) 
            from direct expenditures (\(C_{c}\)) for vessel operations for each cost category (\(c\)), indirect/induced impacts from proprietary income 
            (\(Pm_{p}^{E}\)), the total number of crew positions (\(Crew\)), and captain (\(1\)) employment, where cost-specific multipliers 
            (\(m_{c}^{E}\)) and multipliers for proprietary income (\(m_{p}^{E}\)) are obtained from IO-PAC.</p>
        <p>
            $$Vessel\,income\,impacts = {{\Sigma}_{c=1}^{n}C_{c}m_{c}^{I}+Pm_{p}^{I}+{P}+w_{crew}+w_{captain}}$$
        </p>
        <p>Total Income impacts for each vessel includes indirect/induced income (\(I\)) impacts from expenditures for vessel operations 
            (\(C_{c}m_{c}^{I}\)), indirect/induced impacts from proprietary income (\(Pm_{p}^{I}\)), direct payments to proprietors (\(P\)), 
            and direct wage payments to crew and captain (\(w\)), where cost-specific multipliers (\(m_{c}^{I}\)) and multipliers for proprietary 
            income (\(m_{p}^{I}\)) are obtained from IO-PAC.</p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            The impacts calculated for EDC performance metrics measure the total economic impacts of a particular fishing activity, port, state, or vessel grouping on the entire U.S. West Coast economy. This is in contrast to the impacts that are calculated for the Biennial Harvest Specification (NMFS WCR 2020) which, depending on the analysis, reports on the economic contribution of landings to port areas and states.
        </p>
        <p><b>Fisheye:</b>
            Impacts are calculated for each fishery the vessel participates in. This allows us to report the economic impacts of specific activities and types of operations to the West Coast economy. For example, this method allows for reporting of the total economic impact of all landings within the DTS fishery, or the total contribution of all catch share vessels homeported in Astoria, Oregon.

        <h2>Days at sea</h2>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Days at sea, Days fishing, processing, and steaming in AK, Days fishing, processing, and steaming on the WC, Days offloading on the WC, Days steaming between the WC and AK
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Days at sea is a measure of fishing effort and fishery participation. The catch share program in the U.S. West Coast groundfish trawl fishery was expected to result in greater specialization related to the costs of switching between other fisheries, while there were year-round fishing opportunities in the groundfish fishery (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.1.2(d)(1)). The number of days spent operating in the U.S. West Coast groundfish trawl fishery is driven by a vessel’s ability to obtain quota, fishery-specific costs, and opportunities in other fisheries relative to the groundfish fishery.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            For all U.S. West Coast fisheries and Alaskan fisheries, EDC forms for catcher vessels request information on the number of days at sea the vessel spent fishing. For catcher–processors and motherships, the forms request the number of days spent fishing and processing, steaming, and offloading in the U.S. West Coast Pacific whiting fishery, as well as the days spent steaming between the U.S. West Coast and Alaska, and fishing in Alaska. Partial days are rounded up to full days.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            The following metrics are summarized as vessel averages (mean and median) and fleetwide totals:
            <li>Catcher vessels: Days at sea by fishery</li>
            <li>Catcher-processors and motherships: Days fishing, processing, and steaming in AK, Days fishing, processing, and steaming on the WC, Days offloading on the WC, Days steaming between the WC and AK </li>
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            For use in rate calculations, we use U.S. West Coast fishing days for catcher–processors and motherships, as this is most representative of fishing effort.

    <a href = "#otherfuel"></a>
    <div id = "otherfuel">
        <h2>Fuel use</h2>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Fuel use per day, Annual fuel use
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Fuel use per day (by fishery) provides information about the relative fuel costs across activities as well as across different vessels. This information is also used in combination with days at sea to allocate fuel costs to each fishery. Annual fuel use is also reported.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The current EDC catcher vessel form requests average fuel use per day for 11 separate fisheries. The EDC forms request fuel use per day for each fishery the vessel participates in. Catcher–processors report average fuel use for all U.S. West Coast activities combined, including fishing, processing, and steaming. Similarly, motherships report average fuel use, but only for processing and steaming, since fishing is performed by catcher vessels. Catcher–processors and motherships also report the amount of fuel used annually.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            For fuel use per day, data are summarized as reported on EDC forms, and reported as vessel averages (mean and median). Total fuel use per day is not reported. For catcher–processors and motherships, annual fuel use is also summarized as reported on EDC forms. Annual fuel use by fishery for catcher vessels is calculated by multiplying fuel use per day and days at sea by fishery. Annual fuel use is reported as vessel averages (mean and median), and fleetwide totals.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            For catcher vessels, the fisheries requested on the EDC form have changed slightly over time.

        <h2>Coverage of U.S. West Coast groundfish landings</h2>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Percentage of West Coast groundfish landed weight purchased, Percentage of West Coast groundfish landed value purchased.
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            These metrics summarize the percentage of total weight and value of all U.S. West Coast groundfish landed in each calendar year that are purchased by the processors in the Fisheye population. This provides an indication of Fisheye’s coverage of all U.S. West Coast groundfish landings.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Landed weight and value are obtained from state fish tickets. All groundfish landed are included, even on trips where groundfish species were not targeted. For participants that enter or exit the Fisheye population or for participants that have a fiscal year that does not align with the calendar year, the numerator includes landed weight and value purchased on dates when the participant was active in the Fisheye population.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Landed weight (or value) of groundfish species purchased by Fisheye processors in a given calendar year is divided by the total landed weight (value) of groundfish species landed on the U.S. West Coast in that calendar year, multiplied by 100. This metric is reported for the sector as a whole (total).
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Unlike other processor metrics, these metrics are reported by calendar year rather than survey year (fiscal year), as fiscal years are not known for buyers who do not submit an EDC form. These metrics do not include groundfish purchases from non-vessel sources reported on EDC forms, to avoid double-counting fish transferred between Fisheye processors.

    <a href = "#otherweight"></a>
    <div id = "otherweight">
        <h2>Weight of landings/purchases</h2>
        <p><b>Metrics included:</b>
            Landed weight, Purchase weight (AK), Purchase weight (WC), Catch weight (AK), Catch weight (WC).
        </p>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Fish weight landed or caught is often reported alongside ex-vessel revenue, to provide context to changes in ex-vessel revenue.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Landed weight for catcher vessels is obtained from PacFIN; and catch or purchase weight for motherships and catcher–processors is reported on the EDC forms.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Landed weight is reported by fishery for catcher vessels. Purchase weight on the U.S. West Coast and Alaska is reported separately for motherships. Catch weight on the U.S. West Coast and Alaska is reported separately for catcher–processors. Weight metrics are reported as vessel averages (mean and median) and as fleetwide totals.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            The landed weight reported for catcher vessels does not include at-sea discards.

    <div id = "otherspeed">
        <h3>Speed while fishing</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Speed is collected as a vessel–fishery characteristic. This information is most useful for the development of economic models.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Similar to fuel use per day and number of crew, the EDC forms request speed while fishing (in knots) for each fishery on the U.S. West Coast that the vessel fishes in. This information is only collected for catcher vessels.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            This metric is summarized as reported as a vessel average (mean and median); it is not summarized as a fleetwide total as it would not make sense to sum all values together.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            These values are estimates and represent a vessel’s average speed while fishing in a particular fishery.

    <a href = "#othersharelandings"></a>
    <div id = "othersharelandings">
        <h3>Share of landings by state</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            The U.S. West Coast groundfish trawl fishery spans three states—California, Oregon, and Washington—which necessitates regional comparisons (PFMC and NMFS 2017, 3.1.2(d)(3)(A)). Share of landings by state compares revenue across states and the at-sea fishery as a percentage of total revenue. This metric is only calculated for catcher vessels.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Ex-vessel revenue is obtained from fish ticket data maintained by PacFIN.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Data are grouped by state to determine revenue by state, divided by total ex-vessel revenue, and multiplied by 100 to get the percentage of revenue by state.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Unlike most other metrics, Share of landings by state is not summarized as mean, median, or total; it is visualized with a separate line for each state.

    <a href = "#othergini"></a>
    <div id = "othergini">
        <h3>Gini coefficient</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Gini coefficient provides a measure of revenue equality, and ranges from zero (perfect equality, where everyone receives an equal share) to one (perfect inequality, where one recipient receives all of the shares; PFMC and NMFS 2017, Table 4). A higher Gini coefficient over time indicates that revenue concentration is increasing.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The Gini coefficient is calculated for all sectors. For vessels, we use ex-vessel revenue from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN and NORPAC. For processors, we use revenue reported on the EDC forms.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            We use the Gini function in R to estimate the Gini coefficient. Gini is estimated by determining the Lorenz curve (distribution of revenue) and subtracting the area under the Lorenz curve from the area under the line of equality (0.5) divided by the area under the line of equality, or essentially double the area between the Lorenz curve and the line of equality.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Mean, median, and total statistics do not apply to Gini coefficient.

    </div>

    <a href = "#otherseasonality"></a>
    <div id = "otherseasonality">
        <h3>Seasonality</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            It was expected that the additional flexibility associated with catch shares would change the timing of landings. This metric summarizes the timing of landings by reporting the day of the year upon which 50% of that year’s total catch was landed.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Seasonality is calculated for catcher vessels, motherships, and catcher–processors using ex-vessel revenue from fish tickets maintained by PacFIN and NORPAC.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            We summarize landings weight by day of year, and then calculate the cumulative totals for each day. The day of the year where the cumulative total is 50% of the annual total is then reported.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Mean, median, and total statistics do not apply to Seasonality. This metric is meant to provide a broad overview of the timing of fisheries; for more in-depth information, the NWFSC Landings Tracker is available in Fisheye.

    <a href = "#otherproductionprocessed"></a>
    <div id = "otherproductionprocessed">
        <h3>Percentage of production processed</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Shorebased processors sell both processed and unprocessed products. This metric summarizes the percentage of processed seafood products (i.e., not recorded as unprocessed) sold, and provides an indication of processing operations within this sector.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            The EDC forms require processors to report production weight by product type. See Number of species processed (Measures of Specialization) for a list of product types by species.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            For this metric, all production listed as any product type other than “Unprocessed” is considered processed products. Production weight of processed products is divided by total production weight of all products (processed and unprocessed), and multiplied by 100. This metric is reported as processor averages (mean and median); total percentage of production processed is not reported.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            The product type Fresh (used in 2009–10) was renamed Processed Fresh from 2011 onward; this may have influenced what respondents include in this category. It is counted as a processed product type for this metric.

    <a href = "#othernonvessel"></a>
    <div id = "othernonvessel">
        <h3>Percentage of purchases from non-vessel sources</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Some processors purchase fish from non-vessel sources, in addition to vessel sources. This metric summarizes the percentage of fish inputs purchased from non-vessel sources, which can include first receivers, processors, wholesale dealers, brokers, and aquaculture producers.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            EDC forms require processors to report purchases by source, including limited entry trawl vessels, limited entry fixed gear vessels, other vessels, and non-vessel sources.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Purchase weight of non-vessel-sourced fish is divided by total purchase weight of all fish inputs, and multiplied by 100. This metric is reported for the average processor (mean and median) and for the sector as a whole (total).
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            This metric is not available for 2009 and 2010, as non-vessel sources were not explicitly requested on the EDC forms in those years.

    </div>

    <a href = "#othertrips"></a>
    <div id = "othertrips">
        <h3>Trips</h3>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Trips is another measure of effort, and is a common unit of analysis. In some cases, trips may be preferred over days at sea because the Trips metric does not include the uncertainty associated with self-reporting days at sea.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Data are obtained from PacFIN.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            For each vessel, trips are summed by fishery to yield the number of trips. Trips are summarized as vessel averages (mean and median) and fleetwide totals.
        </p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            Currently this metric is not provided for motherships or catcher–processors.
