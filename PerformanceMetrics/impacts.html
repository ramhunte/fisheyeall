        <h2>Economic contribution (impacts) to the U.S. West Coast economy</h2>
        <p><b>Purpose:</b>
            Provide the total economic contribution (income and employment) of the catch share program to the U.S. West Coast economy.
        </p>
        <p><b>Data:</b>
            Data from fish tickets, EDC forms, and the Input–Output Model for Pacific Coast fisheries (IO-PAC; Leonard 2011) are used to calculate total impacts. The number of positions and direct expenditures are obtained directly from the EDC data. Proprietary income is calculated based on revenue from fish tickets and the EDC forms minus EDC-reported expenditures. Multipliers for employment and income are obtained from IO-PAC.
        </p>
        <p><b>Methods:</b>
            Economic contributions are calculated by combining costs allocated to individual fisheries (see Cost Allocation) and ex-vessel revenue with IO-PAC multipliers to calculate total U.S. West Coast employment and income impacts:
        </p>
        <p>
            $$Vessel\,employment\,impacts = {{\Sigma}_{c=1}^{n}C_{c}m_{c}^{E}+Pm_{p}^{E}+Crew+1}$$
        </p>
        <p>Total Employment impacts for each vessel includes the indirect/induced employment (\(E\)) impacts (\(C_{c}m_{c}^{E}\)) 
            from direct expenditures (\(C_{c}\)) for vessel operations for each cost category (\(c\)), indirect/induced impacts from proprietary income 
            (\(Pm_{p}^{E}\)), the total number of crew positions (\(Crew\)), and captain (\(1\)) employment, where cost-specific multipliers 
            (\(m_{c}^{E}\)) and multipliers for proprietary income (\(m_{p}^{E}\)) are obtained from IO-PAC.</p>
        <p>
            $$Vessel\,income\,impacts = {{\Sigma}_{c=1}^{n}C_{c}m_{c}^{I}+Pm_{p}^{I}+{P}+w_{crew}+w_{captain}}$$
        </p>
        <p>Total Income impacts for each vessel includes indirect/induced income (\(I\)) impacts from expenditures for vessel operations 
            (\(C_{c}m_{c}^{I}\)), indirect/induced impacts from proprietary income (\(Pm_{p}^{I}\)), direct payments to proprietors (\(P\)), 
            and direct wage payments to crew and captain (\(w\)), where cost-specific multipliers (\(m_{c}^{I}\)) and multipliers for proprietary 
            income (\(m_{p}^{I}\)) are obtained from IO-PAC.</p>
        <p><b>Caveats:</b>
            The impacts calculated for EDC performance metrics measure the total economic impacts of a particular fishing activity, port, state, or vessel grouping on the entire U.S. West Coast economy. This is in contrast to the impacts that are calculated for the Biennial Harvest Specification (NMFS WCR 2020) which, depending on the analysis, reports on the economic contribution of landings to port areas and states.
        </p>
        <p><b>Fisheye:</b>
            Impacts are calculated for each fishery the vessel participates in. This allows us to report the economic impacts of specific activities and types of operations to the West Coast economy. For example, this method allows for reporting of the total economic impact of all landings within the DTS fishery, or the total contribution of all catch share vessels homeported in Astoria, Oregon.
